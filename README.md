## HEYJARVIS - Python Voice Assistant
Python-based personal voice assistant inspired by Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System). Features modular architecture for easy customization and extensibility.
Purpose

#### This repository is intended for educational purposes ONLY to demonstrate:
- Speech recognition and text-to-speech implementation
- Modular Python project architecture
- Voice command processing and handling
- Integration of various Python libraries for AI assistant functionality
- Configuration management and API integration

#### Important Notice ⚠️
**Do NOT copy/replicate this code directly**. This repository is meant to help you understand the concepts line by line. Study how speech recognition works, how modules are organized, how commands are processed, and how external APIs are integrated. Then build your own version based on your understanding.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/embdevv/heyjarvis.git```
```cd heyjarvis```

2. Install dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Configure API keys in config.py (if required)
4. Run the assistant
```python main.py```

#### How It Works
The assistant follows a modular pattern where each feature is separated into its own module for maintainability and scalability. Voice commands are processed through speech recognition, matched against available commands, and executed accordingly.

##### Learn, understand, then build your own.
